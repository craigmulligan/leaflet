        'Leaflet is a simple tool to help you eat more plant based meals week on week. You give it a simple prompt to customize it to your needs and it will then send you a weekly "leaflet" of randomly selected simple plant-based recipes.',

        "I grew up in South Africa, a country like many others, whose cuisine is dominated by meat. As I was transitioning to a plant based diet, I didn't have any vegetarian recipes to fallback on. I found learning a totally new set of \"go-to\" recipes difficult. But it's also useful if you'd just like to learn new recipes.",
