Every week you'll get an email with a number of recipes and shopping list. The recipe selection is random but guided by your preferences. We try select recipes that are seasonal and have common ingredients to reduce waste and cost of the meal.

# Why did I make this

I grew up in South Africa & like many of you I grew up eating a lot of meat. 
When I decided to switch to a vegetarian diet, I realized how few plant based meals I had in my repertoire.
I don't consider myself a foodie and had little desire comb through recipe sites to plan my meals for the week.
