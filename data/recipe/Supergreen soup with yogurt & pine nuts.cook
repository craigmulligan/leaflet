Heat the @oil{2%tsp} in a medium saucepan over a low-medium heat. Add the @onion{1} and a pinch of salt, then cook slowly, stirring occasionally, for ~{10%min}s until softened but not coloured. Add the @garlic{2%clove} and cook for ~{1%min} more.

Tip in the @potato{1} followed by the veg @stock{600%ml}. Simmer for ~{10-12%min}s until the potato is soft enough that a cutlery knife will slide in easily. Add the @bag{120%g} of salad and let it wilt for ~{1%min}, then blitz the soup in a blender until itâ€™s completely smooth.

Serve with a dollop of @yogurt{150%g}, some toasted @pine nuts{20%g} and a drizzle of @chilli oil{}, if you like.
