Mix the vegetarian, @chicken-style pieces{152.5%g} with the @lime{5} juice, @chilli powder{0.5%tsp} and @garlic{1%clove}.

Heat the @oil{1%tsp} in a non-stick frying pan then fry the pieces for a couple of mins, while you warm the @wraps{2} following the pack instructions or if you have a gas hob, heat them over the flame to slightly char them. Do not let them dry out or they are difficult to roll.

Squash half an @avocado{1} onto each wrap, add the peppers to the pan to warm them through then pile onto the wraps with the chicken-style pieces, and sprinkle over the @coriander{}. Roll up, cut in half and eat with your fingers.
