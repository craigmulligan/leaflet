Toast the @cumin seeds{1.25%tsp} briefly in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Spoon in the @paprika{2%tsp} and @coriander{2%tsp}, then tip in 2½ @cans{202%g} of beans along with their liquid, the @tomatoes{400%g}, @tomato purée{1%tbsp}, @bouillon{1%tbsp}, @garlic{3%large} and 500ml water. Cover and leave to simmer for ~{15%min}s.

Meanwhile, stir the ingredients for the raita together in a bowl.

Blitz the cooked beans using a hand blender until completely smooth, then stir in the remaining beans and return to the boil. Serve half and top with half the raita, a chopped avocado and some extra @coriander{15%g}. Leave the remaining soup to cool, then chill for another day. Will keep chilled for four days; the raita will keep for two days. Reheat the soup in a pan over a low-medium heat until piping hot.
