Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6. Toss the @oil{2%tbsp} with the @chickpeas{400%g}, spices and @chilli flakes{0.5%tsp} in a medium roasting tin. Roast for ~{15%min}s or until the chickpeas are beginning to crisp and turn golden brown. Add the @tomatoes{270%g}, apricots, @olives{70%g} and @freekeh{250%g} to the pan and toss everything together. Return to the oven for a final ~{10-15%min}s until the tomatoes start to burst and everything is piping hot. Season to taste.

Combine the @yogurt{70%g} and most of the @dill{0%small} and season with salt. Serve the freekeh with any extra dill fronds scattered over and a dollop of the herby yogurt.
