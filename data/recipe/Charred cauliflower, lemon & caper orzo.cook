Heat the grill to high. Toss the @cauliflower{0.5} with half the @oil{2%tsp} and some seasoning. Tip onto a baking tray and grill for ~{15-20%min}s until golden, charred, and tender all the way through.

Meanwhile, cook the @orzo{100%g} in a pan of boiling salted water for ~{8%min}s, or until al dente. Drain.

Heat the remaining oil in a frying pan and sizzle the @capers{2%tsp} and @garlic{1%small} until golden. Stir in the orzo, cauliflower, @lemon{0.5} zest and juice and the @stock{100%ml}. Bubble for ~{1%min}, then spoon half into a bowl and top with the @rocket{0%handful}. Leave the leftovers to cool for the lunchbox, see tip below.
