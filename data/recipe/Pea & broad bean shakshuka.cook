Trim or snap the woody ends of the @asparagus{1%bunch} and finely slice the spears, leaving the tips and about 2cm at the top intact. Finely slice the @broccoli{200%g} in the same way, leaving the heads and about 2cm of stalk intact. Heat the @oil{2%tbsp} in a frying pan. Add the @spring onions{2}, sliced asparagus and sliced broccoli, and fry gently until the veg softens a little, then add the @cumin seeds{2%tsp}, @cayenne{0%large}, @tomatoes{4} (with their juices), @parsley{1%small} and plenty of seasoning, and stir. Cover with a lid and cook for ~{5%min}s to make a base sauce, then add the asparagus spears, broccoli heads, @peas{50%g} and @broad beans{50%g}, cover again and cook for ~{2%min}s.

Make 4 dips in the mixture. Break an egg into each dip, arrange half the @pea shoots{50%g} around the @eggs{4%large}, season well, cover with a lid and cook until the egg whites are just set. Serve with the rest of the pea shoots, a spoonful of @yogurt and{} some flatbreads, and sprinkle over another pinch of cayenne, if you like.
