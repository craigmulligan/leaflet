    "instructions": "Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the chilli, garlic, ginger, oil, spices and lemon juice in a small bowl with the yogurt and blitz using a hand blender until smooth. Cut the cauliflower carefully into eight, ensuring that you slice through the stalk each time as this will hold it together. Brush the spice paste over both sides of the cauliflower steaks, then arrange on a baking sheet (use two if needed) rubbed with a little oil and roast for 30 mins. Turn over and roast for 20 mins more, or until the cauliflower is tender.\nMeanwhile, put the rice in a large pan with 450ml water, the bouillon and thyme. Bring to the boil, cover and cook for 10 mins, then add the peppers and spring onions, cover again and simmer for 10-15 mins more until the rice is tender. Check towards the end that the water hasn\u2019t run dry as you may need to add a splash more. Add the beans and yogurt and warm through. If you're following the Healthy Diet Plan, serve half the cauliflower and rice, then chill the rest for another day. Will keep for up to two days in the fridge.",
