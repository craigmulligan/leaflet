Heat the @stock{2%l} in a large pan and add the @lentils{150%g}. Bring to the boil and allow the lentils to soften for a few minutes.

Add the @carrots{6} and @leeks{2%medium}, and season (don't add salt if you use ham stock as it will make it too salty). Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover and simmer for ~{45%min}s-1 hr until the lentils have broken down. Scatter over the @parsley{0%small} and serve with buttered bread, if you like.
