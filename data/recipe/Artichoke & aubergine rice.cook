Heat 2 tbsp of the @oil{60%ml} in a large non-stick frying pan or @paella{400%g} pan. Fry the @aubergines{2} until nicely coloured on all sides (add another tbsp of oil if the aubergine begins catching too much), then remove and set aside. Add another tbsp of oil to the pan and lightly fry the @onion{1%large} for ~{2-3%min}s or until softened. Add the @garlic{2%clove} and @parsley{0%small} stalks, cook for a few mins more, then stir in the spices and rice until everything is well coated. Heat for ~{2%min}s, add half the @stock{1.5%l} and cook, uncovered, over a medium heat for ~{20%min}s, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking.

Nestle the aubergine and @artichokes{88.5%g} into the mixture, pour over the rest of the stock and cook for ~{20%min}s more or until the rice is cooked through. Chop the parsley leaves, stir through with the lemon juice and season well. Bring the whole pan to the table and spoon into bowls, with the lemon wedges on the side.
