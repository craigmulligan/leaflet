Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Toss @oil{} and vegetables together and roast in a large, shallow tin for ~{35%min}s until lightly charred. Spoon a layer of roasted veg over the bottom of a medium-size baking dish.

Pour over some @passata{350%ml} and cover with a layer of @lasagne sheets{200%g}. Repeat layers to use up all the roasted veg and passata, finishing with a layer of lasagne. Use a spoon to dollop over the @crème fraîche{6%tbsp}, then sprinkle with the @Parmesan{}. Return to the oven for ~{25%min}s, until the lasagne is heated through and the top is golden and bubbling.
