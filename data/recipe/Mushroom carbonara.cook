Cook the @mushrooms{100%g} in a large non-stick pan over a medium-high heat, shuffling the pan occasionally until deeply browned. Transfer to a plate. Drizzle the @oil{1%tbsp} into the pan and cook the @garlic{2%clove} and shallots for a few minutes until softened.

Put the @egg{1}, @parmesan{10%g} and @parsley{0%small} in a bowl and whisk with a fork to combine. Put the pasta and 400ml boiling water into the pan with the shallots and simmer for ~{8-10%min}s until reduced and the pasta is cooked. Remove from the heat and stir in the egg mix and @mushrooms{100%g}. Leave to stand for ~{1%min} before stirring again, then season to taste. Add a little more water if the pasta looks too dry. Sprinkle over extra parmesan and grind over some black pepper, if you like.
