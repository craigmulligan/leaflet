Mix all the ingredients except for the @tortilla{1%large} and toss well.

Put the tortilla on a sheet of foil and pile the filling along one side of the wrap â€“ it will almost look like too much mixture, but once you start to roll it firmly it will compact. Roll the tortilla from the filling side, folding in the sides as you go. Fold the foil in at the ends to keep stuff inside the wrap. Cut in half and eat straight away. If taking to work, leave whole and wrap up like a cracker in baking parchment.
