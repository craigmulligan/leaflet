Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Place the pepper halves in a shallow baking dish, skin-side up, and roast for ~{15-20%min}s.

Meanwhile, tip the spices into a pan and warm briefly to release their flavour. Tip in the @tomatoes{400%g} and stir in the @onion{1}, @garlic{1%clove}, @chilli{1}, @aubergine{1%small} and @kidney beans{220%g} with their juice. Cover the pan and cook for ~{20%min}s, stirring occasionally. Try not to add any extra liquid; the mixture should be quite dry. Stir in the @coriander{1%tsp}.

Meanwhile, beat the @egg{1%large} with the @feta{25%g} and @fromage frais{50%g}. Turn the @peppers{2%large} over and pile the aubergine mixture into each one, packing it down as much as you can. Top with the feta mixture and return to the oven for ~{10%min}s more until the topping has lightly set. Donâ€™t worry if some of it flows off, as it will just set in the dish. Serve the peppers on the @rocket{2%handful} with @lime wedges{} for squeezing over.
