Heat the @oil{3%tbsp} in a large saucepan and add the @onions{2}, @carrots{3}, @celery{3} and @garlic{3%clove}. Cook gently for ~{15-20%min}s until everything is softened. Stir in the @lentils{500%g}, @chopped tomatoes{201%g}, @tomato purée{2%tbsp}, herbs and @stock{1%l}. Bring to a simmer, then cook for ~{40-50%min}s until the lentils are tender and saucy – splash in water if you need. Season.

If eating straight away, keep on a low heat while you cook the @spaghetti{500%g}, following pack instructions. Drain well, divide between pasta bowls or plates, spoon sauce over the top and grate over some cheese. Alternatively, cool the sauce and chill for up to ~{3%days}. Or freeze for up to 3 months. Simply defrost portions overnight at room temperature, then reheat gently to serve.
