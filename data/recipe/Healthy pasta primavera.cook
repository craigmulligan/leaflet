Bring a pan of salted water to the boil and put a steamer (or colander) over the water. Steam the @beans{75%g}, @asparagus{51%g} and @peas{170%g} until just tender, then set aside. Boil the pasta following @pack{175%g} instructions.

Meanwhile, fry the leeks gently in the @oil{1%tbsp} and @butter{1%tbsp} for ~{5%min}s or until soft. Add the @fromage frais{200%ml} to the leeks and very gently warm through, stirring constantly to ensure it doesnâ€™t split. Add the @herbs{0%handful} and steamed vegetables with a splash of pasta water to loosen.

Drain the pasta and stir into the sauce. Adjust the seasoning, then serve scattered with the cheese and drizzled with a little extra olive oil.
