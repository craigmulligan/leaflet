Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the @tomatoes{400%g}, @onion{1} and @peppers{2} in a roasting tin, toss with the @oil{2%tbsp} and season. Nestle in the @garlic{2%clove} and @thyme sprigs{}, then roast for ~{25-30%min}s until all the veg has softened and slightly caramelised. Squeeze the garlic cloves out of their skins into the tin, strip the @leaves{} off the thyme and discard the stalks and garlic skins. Mix the @vinegar{1%tbsp} into the tin then blend everything in a bullet blender or using a stick blender, adding enough water to loosen to your preferred consistency (we used around 150ml).

Reheat the soup if necessary, taste for seasoning, then spoon into two bowls and top each with a spoonful of @ricotta{2%tbsp}, a few basil leaves, the seeds and a drizzle of oil. Serve with @bread{} for dunking.
