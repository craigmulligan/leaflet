Bring a pan of water to the boil, lower in the @eggs{2%large} and boil for ~{8%min}s. Drain and run under the cold tap to cool them a @little{2}, then peel and halve. Meanwhile, mix 1 tbsp @lemon{1} juice and 3 tbsp water with the @tahini{1%tbsp} to make a dressing.

Heat the @oil{1%tbsp} and fry the @onion{1} and @garlic{3%large} for ~{5%min}s to soften them. Add the ground @cumin{1%tsp} and seeds, stir briefly then add the @beans{400%g} and lightly crush some of them as you heat them, adding some of the juice from the can to get a nice creamy consistency but keeping whole beans, too. Taste and add lemon juice and just a little seasoning if you need to.

Spoon the beans on to plates with the lettuce, then add the eggs and @tomatoes{2}, with the tahini dressing, @chilli{} and parsley, if using.
