Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Using a sharp knife, peel the @butternut squash{1}. Cut it in half lengthways, scoop out the seeds, then cut into 1cm-thick slices widthways across the squash.

Put the squash slices in a large roasting tin with the @onion{1}, @peppers{3} and @garlic{2%clove}. Mix the @oil{3%tbsp} with the @curry paste{3%tbsp} and drizzle over the vegetables. Toss well to coat in the curry mix and season.

Roast for ~{30%min}s until the vegetables are beginning to soften. Add the @lentils{201%g} and @stock{150%ml} to the roasting tin and mix. Return to the oven for a further ~{5-10%min}s until the vegetables are tender. Stir in the @coriander{0%large} and serve straight away.
