Boil the @quinoa{100%g} for ~{20%min}s following pack instructions, leave to stand for ~{5%min}s, then drain well. Meanwhile, fry the @onions{2} in 1 tbsp @oil{2%tbsp} over a medium-low heat for ~{5%min}s with the lid on the pan, then uncover and fry for ~{5%min}s more until soft and starting to colour. Take off the heat, stir in the @black beans{201%g}, @oregano{2%tsp}, @peanut butter{3.5%tbsp}, @parsley{3%tbsp} and @bouillon{1%tsp}, then mash everything together with a potato masher to crush the beans. Add the quinoa and @eggs{2} and mix well.

Heat the remaining 1 tbsp oil in a large non-stick frying pan then, using a measuring tablespoon, scoop rounded spoonfuls of the mixture and add to the pan, spaced apart. Cook for about ~{2-3%min}s each side until the nuggets are browned. Cook half the mixture and save the remainder for another day. Will keep chilled for up to three days.

To make the coleslaw, put the @yogurt{90%g}, @mustard powder{1%tsp} and @vinegar{1%tsp} in a bowl, stir together to make a dressing, then add the vegetables and @coriander{4%tbsp} and toss well. Serve half the coleslaw with two portions of the nuggets. The remainder will keep chilled for up to three days.
