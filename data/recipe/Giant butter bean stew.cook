Drain the canned @beans{246.33%g}, reserving 200ml of the liquid. Heat the @oil{100%ml} in a large flameproof lidded casserole dish, and cook the @onions{3%small}, @carrots{2%large} and @celery{3} until tender and the onions are soft and transparent, but not coloured. Stir in the remaining ingredients, reserving half of the chopped herbs and @feta{100%g} (if using).

Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Cook over a gentle heat for a further ~{5%min}s, then pour over the reserved liquid. Cover the dish and bake in the oven for ~{40%min}s. Check occasionally that the beans are not drying out â€“ add a little more water if needed.

Remove the lid and bake for ~{10%min}s more. Can be made ~{2%days} ahead and reheated. Stir through the reserved chopped herbs, season to taste, then crumble over the remaining feta just before serving.
