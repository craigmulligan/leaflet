Heat the @oil{1%tbsp} in a large saucepan. Cook the @garlic{1%clove} for a few seconds, then add the @courgettes{500%g} and cook for ~{3%min}s until they start to soften. Stir in the @peas{200%g} and @cannellini beans{400%g}, pour on the @hot{1%l} stock and cook for a further ~{3%min}s.

Stir the @pesto{2%tbsp} through the soup with some seasoning, then ladle into bowls and serve with crusty brown bread, if you like. Or pop in a flask to take to work.
