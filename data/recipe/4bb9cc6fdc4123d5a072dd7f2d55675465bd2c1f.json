    "instructions": "Heat the grill to high. Toss the cauliflower with half the oil and some seasoning. Tip onto a baking tray and grill for 15-20 mins until golden, charred, and tender all the way through.\nMeanwhile, cook the orzo in a pan of boiling salted water for 8 mins, or until al dente. Drain.\nHeat the remaining oil in a frying pan and sizzle the capers and garlic until golden. Stir in the orzo, cauliflower, lemon zest and juice and the stock. Bubble for 1 min, then spoon half into a bowl and top with the rocket. Leave the leftovers to cool for the lunchbox, see tip below.",
