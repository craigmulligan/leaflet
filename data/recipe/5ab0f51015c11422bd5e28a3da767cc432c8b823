Mash the beans, keeping them quite chunky, then keep warm.\nToss the slices of feta in a little flour. Heat a non-stick frying pan, wipe with a little oil then cook the feta for a few minutes on each side until golden and warmed through, flipping over to make sure they're cooked evenly. Spoon the bean mash onto plates, top with the feta and half the salsa then scatter with extra dill. Serve with the rocket on the side and the rest of the salsa in a bowl.",
