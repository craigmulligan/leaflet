Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Brush both sides of the aubergine slices with 2 tbsp of the @oil{3%tbsp}, lay on baking sheets, season and bake for ~{15-20%min}s until tender, turning once. Cook the @lentils{140%g} following @pack{0.5%small} instructions.

Heat the remaining oil in a large frying pan. Tip in the @onions{2} and @garlic{3%clove} and cook until soft. Stir though the @squash{300%g} and the tomatoes, plus Â½ @can{400%g} of water. Simmer for ~{10-15%min}s until the sauce has thickened. Stir in the lentils, basil and seasoning.

Spoon a layer of lentils into a small baking dish. Top with aubergine slices and repeat, finishing with a layer of aubergine. Scatter with @mozzarella{125%g} and bake for a further ~{15%min}s until the cheese is golden and bubbling.
