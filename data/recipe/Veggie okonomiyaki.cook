Whisk together the @eggs{3%large}, @flour{50%g} and @milk{50%ml} until smooth. Add half the @spring onions{4}, the @pak choi{1}, @cabbage{200%g}, @chilli{1} and @soy sauce{0.5%@tbsp{1}}. Heat the @oil{0.5%tbsp} in a small frying pan and pour in the batter. Cook, covered, over a medium heat for ~{7-8%min}s. Flip the okonomiyaki into a second frying pan, then return it to the heat and cook for a further ~{7-8%min}s until a skewer inserted into it comes out clean.

Mix the mayonnaise and @lime{0.5} juice together in a small bowl. Transfer the okonomiyaki to a plate, then drizzle over the lime mayo and top with the extra chilli and spring onion and the @sushi ginger{}, if using. Serve with the @wasabi{} on the side, if you like.
