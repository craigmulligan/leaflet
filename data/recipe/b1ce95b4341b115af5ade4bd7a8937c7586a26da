    "instructions": "Rinse the rice under cold running water, rubbing with your fingers to remove any excess starch. Cook following pack instructions, then drain well.\nBring another pan of water to a simmer. Cook the green beans for 2 mins, then transfer to a bowl with a slotted spoon and set aside. Boil the eggs in the pan for 7 mins, then drain and transfer to a bowl of cold water to cool.\nMeanwhile, heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Fry the onions for 10-15 mins until golden. Add the garlic, curry powder, turmeric and bay leaves and cook for 1 min more. Stir in the spinach, tomatoes and a splash of water and cook for another 5 mins until the spinach has wilted.\nFold the cooked rice and green beans through the spinach mixture and cook for a few minutes until the rice is warmed through. Drain and gently peel the eggs, then slice in half.\nTop the rice mixture with the eggs, coriander and chilli. Serve the vedgeree with the lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over.",
