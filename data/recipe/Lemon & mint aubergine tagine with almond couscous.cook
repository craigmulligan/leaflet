Heat the @oil{1%tbsp} in a large non-stick pan and fry the @onion{1%large} and @garlic{3%clove} for ~{5%min}s. Stir in the @harissa{1%tbsp}, @cumin{1%tsp} and @cinnamon{0.5%tsp}, cook briefly, then tip in the @stock{200%ml} and tomatoes.

Add the aubergines and @lemon{2%strip}, then cover the pan and cook gently for ~{15-20%min}s until the aubergines are meltingly tender. Add the @butter{390%g} beans and warm through.

Meanwhile, cook the @couscous{175%g} following pack instructions, then stir in the almonds. Serve the @aubergine{350%g} tagine on the couscous with the @yogurt{150%g} drizzled over, and garnish with mint leaves, if you like.
