In a food processor, whizz the @chickpeas{400%g}, @lemon{1} zest, lemon juice, @cumin{1%tsp}, half the @coriander{0%small}, the @egg{1} and some seasoning. Scrape into a bowl and mix with 80g of the @breadcrumbs{100%g} and the diced onions. Form 4 burgers, press remaining breadcrumbs onto both sides and chill for at least ~{10%min}s.

Heat the @oil{1%tbsp} in a frying pan until hot. Fry the burgers for ~{4%min}s each side, keeping the heat on medium so they donâ€™t burn. To serve, slice each bun and fill with a slice of @tomato{1%large}, a burger, a few @red onion{1%medium} slices, some cucumber slices, a dollop of chilli sauce and the remaining coriander.
