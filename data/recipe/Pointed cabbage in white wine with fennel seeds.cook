In a large saucepan, heat the @olive oil{2%tbsp}, add the @fennel seeds{1%tsp} and toast for ~{1%min} to release the flavour. Stir in the @onion{1%large} and cook gently for ~{2%min}s, then stir in the @cabbage{1%large} to coat in the oil and fennel.

Pour in the @white @wine{1%tbsp}{250%ml} and vinegar, allow to reduce by about half for ~{5%min}s, then simmer on the hob for another ~{5%min}s until the cabbage is cooked and the sauce has thickened slightly. Stir in the @coriander{0.5%small} and serve.
