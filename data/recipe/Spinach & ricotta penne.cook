Cook the pasta following pack instructions until al dente, about ~{12%min}s.

Meanwhile, heat the @oil{2%tsp} in a deep frying pan over a medium heat and cook the @garlic{2%large} and @leeks{2} for ~{5%min}s, stirring until soft. Add the @spinach{250%g}, cover and cook for ~{3%min}s more until wilted. Stir well.

Mix the @ricotta{85%g} with the @milk{3%tbsp}, cheese and a @grating of nutmeg{}. Drain the pasta (reserving a mugful of the water), and add it to the veg. Pour over the ricotta mixture and toss well to combine. Add 3-4 tbsp of the reserved pasta water to loosen a little, then serve.
