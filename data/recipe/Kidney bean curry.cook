Heat the @oil{1%tbsp} in a large frying pan over a low-medium heat. Add the @onion{1} and a pinch of salt and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until softened and just starting to colour. Add the @garlic{2%clove}, @ginger{} and @coriander{1%small} stalks and cook for a further ~{2%min}s, until fragrant.

Add the spices to the pan and cook for another ~{1%min}, by which point everything should smell aromatic. Tip in the @chopped tomatoes{400%g} and @kidney beans{400%g} in their water, then bring to the boil.

Turn down the heat and simmer for ~{15%min}s until the curry is nice and thick. Season to taste, then serve with the @basmati rice{} and the coriander leaves.
