    "instructions": "Cook the mushrooms in a large non-stick pan over a medium-high heat, shuffling the pan occasionally until deeply browned. Transfer to a plate. Drizzle the oil into the pan and cook the garlic and shallots for a few minutes until softened.\nPut the egg, parmesan and parsley in a bowl and whisk with a fork to combine. Put the pasta and 400ml boiling water into the pan with the shallots and simmer for 8-10 mins until reduced and the pasta is cooked. Remove from the heat and stir in the egg mix and mushrooms. Leave to stand for 1 min before stirring again, then season to taste. Add a little more water if the pasta looks too dry. Sprinkle over extra parmesan and grind over some black pepper, if you like.",
