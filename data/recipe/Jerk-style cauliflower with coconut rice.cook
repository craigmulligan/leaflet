Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the @chilli{1%large}, @garlic{2%clove}, @ginger{15%g}, @oil{1%tbsp}, spices and @lemon juice{2%tbsp} in a small bowl with the @yogurt{2%tbsp} and blitz using a hand blender until smooth. Cut the @cauliflower{1%large} carefully into eight, ensuring that you slice through the stalk each time as this will hold it together. Brush the spice paste over both sides of the cauliflower steaks, then arrange on a baking sheet (use two if needed) rubbed with a little oil and roast for ~{30%min}s. Turn over and roast for ~{20%min}s more, or until the cauliflower is tender.

Meanwhile, put the @rice{150%g} in a large pan with 450ml water, the @bouillon{2%tsp} and @thyme{3}. Bring to the boil, cover and cook for ~{10%min}s, then add the @peppers{2} and @spring onions{1%bunch}, cover again and simmer for ~{10-15%min}s more until the rice is tender. Check towards the end that the water hasnâ€™t run dry as you may need to add a splash more. Add the @beans{400%g} and @yogurt{3%tbsp} and warm through. If you're following the Healthy Diet Plan, serve half the cauliflower and rice, then chill the rest for another day. Will keep for up to two days in the fridge.
