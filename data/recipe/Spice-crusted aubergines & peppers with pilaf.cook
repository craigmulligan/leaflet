Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Using a sharp knife, score a diamond pattern into the @aubergines{2%large}. Brush with 1 tbsp of the @oil{2%tbsp}, season well and place on a baking tray, cut-side down. Cook in the oven for ~{15%min}s. Add the @peppers{2} to the tray, turn the aubergines over and drizzle everything with the remaining oil. Sprinkle over the spices, 1 tbsp of the @pomegranate molasses{4%tbsp} and a little salt. Roast in the oven for ~{15%min}s more.

Boil the @lentils{140%g} in plenty of water until al dente. After theyâ€™ve been boiling for ~{5%min}s, add the @rice{140%g}. Cook for ~{10%min}s or until cooked through but with a bit of bite. Drain and return to the pan, covered with a lid to keep warm.

Stir the @pomegranate{1} seeds and @parsley{0%small} through the lentil rice. Divide between four plates or tip onto a large platter. Top with the roasted veg, a dollop of @yogurt{} and the remaining pomegranate molasses drizzled over.
