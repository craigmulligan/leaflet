    "instructions": "Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Boil the potatoes for 5 mins until just cooked, then drain. Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl with the chillies, garlic and lots of black pepper. For the salsa, lightly oil the pepper halves and place, cut-side down, on a baking sheet.\nStir the potatoes into the egg mixture, then tip into a shallow, lightly oiled ovenproof dish (ours was a deep 30cm dish). Cook in the oven with the peppers on the shelf above for 25-30 mins until the egg is set and starting to brown at the edges.\nMeanwhile, tip the sweetcorn into a bowl with the onion and basil, and stir in the lime zest and juice. Peel the roasted peppers, dice the flesh, and add to make the salsa.\nServe half the frittata with half the salsa and half the rocket for two people. The remainder will keep chilled for up to three days. Serve cold or lightly warmed with the remaining salsa.",
