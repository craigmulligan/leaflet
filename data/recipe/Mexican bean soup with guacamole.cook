Heat the @oil{2%tsp} in a medium pan, add the @onion{1%large} (reserving 1 tbsp to make the guacamole later) and @pepper{1} and fry, stirring frequently, for ~{10%min}s. Stir in the @garlic{2%clove} and spices, then tip in the @tomatoes{400%g} and @beans{400%g} with their liquid, half a can of water and the @bouillon powder{1%tsp}. Simmer, covered, for ~{15%min}s.

Meanwhile, peel and de-stone the @avocado{1%small} and tip into a bowl, add the remaining onion, @coriander{1%tsp} and @lime{1} juice with a little @chilli{2%tsp} (if using) and mash well. Ladle the soup into two bowls, top with the guacamole and serve.
