Heat the @oil{2%tbsp} in a medium non-stick, ovenproof frying pan. Tip in the sliced @onions{3} and cook over a medium heat for about ~{10%min}s until soft and golden. Add the @Madras{1%tbsp} paste and fry for ~{1%min} more, then tip in half the @tomatoes{500%g} and half the @chilli{1}. Cook until the mixture is thick and the tomatoes have all burst.

Heat the grill to high. Add half the @coriander{0%small} to the @eggs{8%large} and season, then pour over the spicy onion mixture. Stir gently once or twice, then cook over a low heat for ~{8-10%min}s until almost set. Transfer to the grill for ~{3-5%min}s until set.

To make the salsa, mix the @avocado{1}, remaining chilli and tomatoes, chopped onion, remaining coriander and the @lemon{1} juice together, then season and serve with the frittata.
