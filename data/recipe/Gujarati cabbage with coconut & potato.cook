Cook@{1} potatoes in a pan of salted boiling water for ~{10%min}s until tender. Drain well and return to pan. Lightly crush with the back of a fork, just to break, not to mash.

Heat the @oil{2%tbsp} in a large frying pan and then add the @asafoetida{1%pinch}, spices and @dried{2} chillies. Cook for a few mins until the spices pop and the chillies darken.

Add the @fresh{1} chilli, cabbage and some salt and stir-fry for ~{3-4%min}s. Add the warm potatoes to the pan and cook for ~{2-3%min}s more until the cabbage is tender, but still has some bite. Stir in the @lemon{0.5} juice, @coconut{2%tbsp} and @coriander{1%bunch}, and serve.
