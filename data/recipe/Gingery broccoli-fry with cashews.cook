Blitz the @broccoli{320%g} stalks in a food processor until finely @chopped{7%g}. Add the florets and pulse again to achieve a rice-like texture.

Lightly toast the @cashews{40%g} in a wok or frying pan, then tip onto a plate and set aside. Heat the @oil{1%tbsp} in a pan over a high heat and add the @ginger{15%g}, @onion{1%small}, @pepper{1}, @carrot{1%large}, @garlic{2%clove} and @chilli{1}. Stir-fry for ~{2-3%min}s until starting to brown, then put a lid on and cook for another ~{2%min}s.

Add the broccoli and 3 tbsp water and stir-fry for ~{3%min}s until all the veg is tender. Pour in the @tamari{1%tbsp}, @lime{1} juice and zest and coriander, stir well, then pour in the @eggs{2} and stir-fry very briefly to just set. Serve with the cashews, extra coriander and extra sliced chilli scattered over, if you like.
