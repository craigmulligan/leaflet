Heat the @butter{25%g} in a large saucepan. Add the @onion{1} and a pinch of salt, and cook gently for ~{5%min}s. Tip in the @parsnips{4}, turn up the heat and cook for ~{8-10%min}s, stirring every so often, until the parsnips are starting to brown and caramelise.

Add the @garlic{1%clove} and @sage{10}, and mix through. Tip in the @barley{400%g} and stir to coat well. Pour in the @stock{14%l}, bring to the boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for ~{35-40%min}s, or until nearly all the liquid has been absorbed and the pearl barley is tender but still has a bite. You may need to add a little extra boiling water.

Take off the heat, top with the @Parmesan{25%g} and a knob of butter, then leave to melt. Give the risotto a good stir, then spoon into dishes. Top with more sage, Parmesan and some black pepper.
