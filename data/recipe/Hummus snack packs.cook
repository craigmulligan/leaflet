Tip the @chickpeas{400%g} and @garlic{1%clove} into a bowl with the @cumin{0.5%tsp}, @coriander{1%tsp}, 1 tbsp @lemon juice{1.5%tbsp} and the @oil{1%tbsp}. Add 2 tbsp of the reserved liquid from the chickpeas, then blitz using a hand blender until smooth. If the blender is struggling, add another splash of the liquid. Season and add a little more lemon juice if needed.

Spoon the hummus into four small containers. Will keep covered and chilled for up to three days. Slice the @carrots{68.67} and cucumber into batons when youâ€™re ready to eat and serve with the hummus.
