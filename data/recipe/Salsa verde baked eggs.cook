Drizzle 1 tbsp of the @olive oil{5%tbsp} in a frying pan or skillet, and fry the @paprika{1%tsp} and @cumin{1%tsp} for 30 seconds over a medium heat. Add the canned @tomatoes{400%g} and @fresh{200%g} tomatoes, bring to the boil, then simmer with a lid on over a medium heat for ~{5-6%min}s until the tomatoes have softened.

Meanwhile, put the @garlic{2%clove}, most of the @parsley{1%small}, the @basil{1%small}, @mint{0.5%small}, @capers{2%tbsp}, @mustard{1%tsp}, @white wine vinegar{2%tbsp}, 4 tbsp oil and 3 tbsp cold water in a mini food processor and blitz to a smooth paste. Season.

Stir the @spinach{200%g} into the pan with the tomatoes until wilted (put the lid back on for a few minutes, then stir again to help it wilt). Make four dips in the mixture and gently crack an egg into each one. Cover with a lid and cook over a medium heat for ~{6-8%min}s, or until the @eggs{4} are just set. Uncover the pan, then drizzle over the herby sauce. Scatter over the reserved parsley and @chilli flakes{0.5%tsp}, if using. Serve with @flatbreads{}, if you like.
