Lightly drain the beans, reserving the juice from the tin, but do not rinse (you want the beans in about half the liquid from the @can{400%g}). Depending on the texture you prefer, either mash them roughly in a bowl or blitz them using a blender until smooth. Set aside.

Heat the @oil{1%tbsp} in a large frying pan or casserole and cook the onions for ~{8-10%min}s until soft and golden. Scatter in the @garlic{2%clove}, @chilli{1} and @cumin seeds{1%tsp}, and sizzle everything for ~{2%min}s more. Tip in the beans, @oregano{0.5%tsp}, @paprika{0.5%tsp} and a pinch of salt. Cook everything together for ~{5%min}s until the beans have heated through adding more reserved bean juice if itâ€™s too thick. Serve straightaway with a sprinkling of @coriander{}, if you like, or leave to cool and keep chilled. Will keep chilled for up to three days or frozen for a month. Reheat with a splash of water mixed in.
