Put the kettle on to boil while you finely slice the @onion{1}. Heat the @oil{2%tsp} in a medium pan, add the onion and fry for ~{2%min}s while you slice the @garlic{3%clove} and dice the @carrots{2}. Add them to the pan, and cook briefly over the heat.

Pour in 1 litre of the boiling water from the kettle, stir in the @lentils{85%g} and @stock cube{1}, then cover the pan and cook over a medium heat for ~{15%min}s until the lentils are tender. Take off the heat and stir in the @parsley{}. Ladle into bowls, and scatter with extra parsley leaves, if you like.
