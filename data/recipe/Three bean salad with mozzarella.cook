Boil or steam the green @beans{320%g} and @carrots{4} for ~{8-10%min}s until just tender. Put the sliced @onions{2} in a bowl and pour over boiling water until just covered.

Meanwhile, make the dressing. Mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl.

Tip the cooked @beans{400%g} and carrots into the dressing along with the drained onions, canned @beans{400%g} and @tomatoes{320%g}, toss well, then add the @basil{15%g} and toss again. Serve scattered with the @mozzarella{120%g} and a grinding of black pepper, if you like. Will keep chilled for up to three days.
