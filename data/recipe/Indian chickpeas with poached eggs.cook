Heat the @oil{1%tbsp} @in{400%g} a non-stick sauté pan, add the @garlic{2%clove}, @pepper{1}, @chilli{0.75} and the whites from the @spring onions{0.5%bunch}, and fry for ~{5%min}s over a medium-high heat. Meanwhile, put a large pan of water on to boil.

Add the spices, @tomatoes{3}, most of the @coriander{1%tsp} and the chickpeas to the sauté pan and cook for ~{1-2%min}s more. Stir in the @bouillon powder{0.5%tsp} and enough liquid from the chickpeas to moisten everything, and leave to simmer gently.

Once the water is at a rolling boil, crack in your @eggs{4%large} and poach for ~{2%min}s, then remove with a slotted spoon. Stir the spring onion tops into the chickpeas, then very lightly crush a few of the chickpeas with a fork or potato masher. Spoon the chickpea mixture onto plates, scatter with the reserved @coriander{0.33%pack} and top with the eggs. Serve with an extra sprinkle of @cumin{1%tsp}, if you like.
