Rinse the @quinoa{150%g} in a sieve under running water until the water runs clear, then cook for ~{20%min}s following pack instructions. Leave to rest for ~{5%min}s. Rinse again and drain well by pressing in the sieve.

Meanwhile, put the @vinegar{3%tbsp} and @oil{2%tbsp} in a large bowl, add the @cavolo nero{200%g} and massage in the dressing with your hands to soften it.

Add the quinoa, @onion{1}, @pepper{1} and @raisins{30%g}, then toss well. Spoon half onto plates, scatter over 1 chopped avocado, crumble in half the @feta{40%g} and toss. The remainder will keep chilled for up to three days. Top with the remaining avocado and feta, then serve.
