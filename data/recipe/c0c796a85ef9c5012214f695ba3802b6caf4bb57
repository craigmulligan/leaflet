    "instructions": "Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and fry the onions for 5 mins until they start to colour. Stir in the spices, garlic and chilli, and cook for a few more seconds until aromatic.\nAdd the lentils, chickpeas and stock, then cook, uncovered, for 15 mins until the lentils are tender. Stir in the spinach until wilted.\nRemove half the dhal from the pan and leave to cool. Will keep chilled for up to three days. Break 4 eggs, spaced apart, into the lentils that are left in the pan, cover and cook over a medium heat for 8-10 mins.\nMeanwhile, put all the ingredients for the raita in a bowl and blitz together using a hand blender.\nServe the eggs and dhal with half the raita and scatter over a few extra coriander leaves, if you like. The remaining raita will keep chilled for up to three days. Reheat the remaining dhal in a pan over a medium heat until bubbling. Add a drop of water if it looks dry, then cook the eggs in the hot dhal as described in step 3 and serve with the remaining raita.",
