Put the kettle on to boil. Tip the @saffron{2}, @tomato pur√©e{1%tbsp} and @bouillon powder{2%tsp} into a large heatproof bowl, then pour over 1 litre boiling water and set aside.

Heat the @oil{2%tbsp} in a large paella pan or frying pan over a medium heat and fry the onion for ~{5%min}s, stirring often until starting to soften. Add the @peppers{2}, @garlic{3%clove} and @thyme{2%tbsp}, and cook for a few minutes more. Tip in the @rice{200%g} and @paprika{2%tsp}, and continue to cook, stirring for about a minute. Pour in the saffron stock, then cover and simmer for ~{10%min}s.

Uncover and gently stir, then add the @frozen{320%g} beans and @courgettes{320%g}. Return to a simmer, then cover and cook for another ~{10%min}s until the rice is tender and has absorbed the stock. Leave to stand for ~{5%min}s, then stir in the @parsley{15%g}. Serve half the paella straightaway with @lemon{1} wedges for squeezing over. The other half will keep chilled for up to three days. To enjoy on another day, reheat in the microwave until piping hot throughout.
