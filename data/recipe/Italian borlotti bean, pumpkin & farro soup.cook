Heat the @oil{4%tbsp} in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the @onion{1}, @celery{1}, @pumpkin or squash{750%g} and @carrot{1} and cook until the vegetables have some colour. Add a splash of water and some seasoning, then cover the pan and let the vegetables cook over a very low heat for ~{5%min}s.

Add the @garlic{3%clove} and cook for another couple of mins, then add the @tomato pur√©e{3%tbsp}, @stock{12%l}, @mixed grains{75%g}, @parmesan rinds{65%g}, if using, and some seasoning. Simmer for about ~{15%min}s (or until the grains are cooked), adding the @beans{400%g} for the final ~{5%min}s. In the last few mins, add the @spinach{2%handful}, then taste for seasoning.

If you want to use @sage{5%whole}, fry the leaves whole in a little olive oil before adding to the soup. If you prefer to use parsley, you can just add it directly to the soup. Serve with shavings of parmesan and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil on top of each bowlful. Remove the parmesan rinds and serve.
