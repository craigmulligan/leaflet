Cook the @rice{200%g} in boiling salted water, as per pack instructions. Meanwhile, heat the @oil{1%tbsp} in a large frying pan and cook the @butternut squash{1} for ~{2-3%min}s until lightly browned. Add the @onion{1} and the @curry paste{2%tbsp} and fry for ~{3-4%min}s more.

Pour over the @stock{300%ml}, then cover and simmer for ~{15-20%min}s, or until the squash is tender. Add the @tomatoes{4%large} and @chickpeas{400%g}, then gently cook for ~{3-4%min}s, until the tomatoes slightly soften.
