Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Measure the 2 tbsp of @oil{2%tbsp} into a small bowl. Brush just a little of it onto 2 large, non- stick baking sheets (if you only have 1 tray, bake the @aubergines{3} in batches). Mix the @lemon juice{2%tbsp} into the measured oil. Lay the aubergine slices snugly in a single layer on the baking sheets, brush the tops with half the oil and lemon, season with pepper and bake for ~{20%min}s. Turn the slices over, give the remaining oil and lemon mixture a good stir as it will have separated, and brush it over again. Season with pepper and bake for ~{10-15%min}s more or until softened.

Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tsp oil in a medium saucepan. Add the @onion{1%small} and @garlic{3%clove} and fry for ~{3-4%min}s, stirring often, until the onion is softened and starting to brown. Tip in the cans of @tomatoes{400%g}, stir to break them up, then mix in the @pur√©e{1%tbsp}, pepper and a pinch of salt. Simmer uncovered for about ~{10-12%min}s until thickened and saucy, then stir in the @oregano{2%tbsp}.

Spread a little of the tomato sauce in the bottom of a shallow ovenproof dish (about 25 x 20 x 5cm). Start by laying a third of the aubergine slices widthways across the dish, spread over a third of the remaining sauce and put half the @ricotta{100%g} on top in small spoonfuls, then half the @mozzarella{50%g}. Scatter over half the torn @basil{0%handful} and season well with pepper. Repeat the layering of aubergine slices, tomato sauce, ricotta, mozzarella and basil, and finish with the final aubergine slices, the sliced @tomatoes{225%g} and the last of the sauce. Season with pepper and scatter over the @Parmesan{25%g}. Bake for about ~{20%min}s, or until the cheese is golden and the juices are bubbling.
