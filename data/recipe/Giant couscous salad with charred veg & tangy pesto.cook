Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. In a bowl, toss the @beetroot{2.5}, @onions{3} and @peppers{2} together with the @oil{1%tbsp}, then spread out on a large roasting tray lined with baking paper and roast for ~{35%min}s. Scatter over the @cherry tomatoes{320%g}, then return to the oven for ~{10%min}s more until the tomatoes have softened and the vegetables are tender.

Meanwhile, cook the @couscous{200%g} following pack instructions, then rinse and drain. To make the pesto, put the @coriander{7%g} and half the @parsley{15%g} in a bowl with the @garlic{1%clove}, @chilli{1}, @cumin{0.5%tsp}, @vinegar{1%tbsp}, @oil{1%tbsp} and 25g of the @pine nuts{40%g}. Add 2 tbsp water, then blitz with a hand blender until smooth or use a small food processor.

Toss the roasted veg and chopped parsley through the couscous and pile on the pesto, then scatter with the remaining pine nuts. If you're following the Healthy Diet Plan, serve half of the salad immediately then chill the rest for another day.
