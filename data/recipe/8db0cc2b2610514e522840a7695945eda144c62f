Lay half the slices of aubergine in the base of the slow cooker and top with 3 sheets of lasagne.\nAdd a third of the ratatouille mixture, then the remaining aubergine slices, 3 more lasagne sheets, then the remaining ratatouille mixture.\nCover and cook on High for 2\u00bd - 3 hours until the pasta and vegetables are tender. Turn off the machine.\nScatter 125g vegetarian buffalo mozzarella over the vegetables then cover and leave for 10 mins to settle and melt the cheese.\nScatter with extra basil and serve with a handful of rocket.",
