Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Brush the @mushrooms{2%large} with @a{} little @oil{} and the @garlic{0.5%clove} (if using). Place the mushrooms in two very lightly greased gratin dishes, bottom-side up, and season lightly with pepper. Top with the chopped stalks and thyme, cover with foil and bake for ~{20%min}s.

Remove the foil, add the @tomatoes{2} to the dishes and break an egg carefully onto each of the mushrooms. Season and add a little more thyme, if you like. Return to the oven for ~{10-12%min}s or until the @eggs{2%large} are set but the yolks are still runny. Top with the @rocket{2%handful} and eat straight from the dishes.
